# World Computer Project

**Project Description**: the aim of this project is to build a device that contains no major hardware components, including, but not limited to, storage, memory, CPUs, and GPUs. Instead, all of the computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to fully rigged computers, and are only done so on-demand.

The following repository contains two files:
    
    - a document detailing my preliminary research findings
    
    - a python program (show-cased at ETHSanFranciso 2018) that offloads the processing required to calculate the area underneath a curve       to two other computers to run in parallel. Payment is made to the two computers via microtransactions on the Ethereum network.
